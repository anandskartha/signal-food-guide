# Introduction
The Government of Canada wishes to provide the Canada Food Guide as an online service to improve the health of Canadians. To test the idea an MVP was outlined by the product owner. They are looking to adopt modern cloud-based methodologies to deploy a scalable healthy eating API.

# The Setup
This is a front end application using React and Typescript. It does not make any backend/API calls. It gets the data from csv files under public/data/ folder and processes based on the data. This project uses Tailwind CSS (https://tailwindcss.com/) for creating a responsive web application. It uses Vite (https://vitejs.dev/) instead of Webpack for frontend building and tooling. The experience with Vite has been great and feels much faster than the conventional Webpack setup. 

# Test Env
The app is deployed and available in this Cloudflare link. Please take a look and feel free to raise issues if you find any.
